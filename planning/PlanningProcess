Original plan was to use Riot API, but it didn't have the data I was hoping it would to make it fun, so I've decided to return to the tried ansd true pokeapi!

For data set, I'm going to use the first 152 (og)
Thinking of 5 models:  Pokemon, Types, Abilities, Evolutions, Sprites
5 models, the other 4 will all reference into Pokemon
Types is going to be purely boolean
    5-1-19 decided to port over as-is.  I can convert to boolean in later game logic instead.

5-1-19  Day
decided to change abilities to stats, as the abilities don't have an immediate use for mid-range plans
removed evolutions

5-1-19 Night
Resolved Axios issues.
    notable errors when porting from the tv-browser to make it work for my intents:
        --  first issue:  Spelling oversight for a while.  I mispelled the url which was causing timeouts
                solution:  https://pokeapi.com/api/v1/pokemon/  =>  https://pokeapi.co/api/v1/pokemon/
                Sometimes it's hard to notice those small mistakes!
        --  second issue:  i was initializing at 0.  Pokemon is not 0 base.
                solution:  for (let i = 0; i < pokeCount; i++) =>  for (let i = 1; i < pokeCount; i++)
        --  third issue:  Cast to array error in referencing.
                    reason:  was blindly copy and pasting from previos hw/labs without looking into logic.
                    solution:  stackoverflow and mongoose docs are your friend.  In order to reference it the way I wanted
                                within the pokemon model, I couldn't call for an objectID because I was trying to pass an entire object through
                                to resolve, change types.objectID => types.Mixed

    issue:  Crashed on batch import of all 153
        reason: 28M lines of code is too much for one json.
            solution:  Broke the json import into batches of 20 pokemon per (163k lines per json)
            TODO:  Automate the process, I batched manually by changing integer values for the loop
Updated Seed file to incorporate pulling from multiple batches.  Please advise if there is a more effecient way of doing it than what I utilized.

Pre lunch:
    Currently functional:
                            Axios (getPoke.js)
                            seed.js
                            index.js
                            All Models are individually functional
                            Sprites, Stats, and Types all relate into Pokemon.
                            CRUD on pokemon controller

Post Lunch:
    Implemented full CRUD across the board
    Added a couple unique CRUD for user ease (to look up anything by pokedexID as opposed to _id)
    fixed batch file, had called for one too many and had pokemon from 2nd generation.
