Original plan was to use Riot API, but it didn't have the data I was hoping it would to make it fun, so I've decided to return to the tried ansd true pokeapi!

For data set, I'm going to use the first 152 (og)
Thinking of 5 models:  Pokemon, Types, Abilities, Evolutions, Sprites
5 models, the other 4 will all reference into Pokemon
Types is going to be purely boolean
